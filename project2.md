installed MySql server
`sudo apt install mysql-server`

logged into MySql and I ran the security script

`ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'PassWord.1';`, though I changed the password here


completed set up password for MySql and logged in succesfully

LEMP is fully installed and operational now. Next up is to test PHP with nginx

we can see detailed info of the server after adding the php file
`sudo nano /var/www/projectLEMP/info.php`

```
<?php
phpinfo();
```


![info-php.PNG](./images/info-php.PNG)

Then, for security reasons because of the information in the php info page on server, I removed with `sudo rm /var/www/projectLEMP/info.php`

created example_user and example_database

`CREATE DATABASE `example_database`;`

`CREATE USER 'example_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';` 

used a different password for this user so I had to change the password in subsequent stages needing the password

inserted four rows of content in the database table using the command:

`INSERT INTO example_database.todo_list (content) VALUES ("My first important item");` 

confirmed data in the table using:

`SELECT * FROM example_database.todo_list;` 

inserted PHP script in to query the content of todo_list table

And confirmed this changes by adding */todo_list.php* to the (URL) public IP address on the webpage

PHP ready to connect and interact with the MySql server
