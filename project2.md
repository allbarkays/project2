installed MySql server
`sudo apt install mysql-server`

logged into MySql and I ran the security script

`ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'PassWord.1';`, though I changed the password here


completed set up password for MySql and logged in succesfully

`sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql`

Reload nginx
`sudo systemctl reload nginx`

LEMP is fully installed and operational now. Next up is to test PHP with nginx

we can see detailed info of the server after adding the php file
`sudo nano /var/www/projectLEMP/info.php`

```
<?php
phpinfo();
```


![info-php.PNG](./image/info-php.PNG)

Then, for security reasons because of the information in the php info page on server, I removed with `sudo rm /var/www/projectLEMP/info.php`

created example_user and example_database

`CREATE DATABASE `example_database`;`

`CREATE USER 'example_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';` 

used a different password for this user so I had to change the password in subsequent stages needing the password

inserted four rows of content in the database table using the command:

`INSERT INTO example_database.todo_list (content) VALUES ("My first important item");` 

confirmed data in the table using:

`SELECT * FROM example_database.todo_list;` 

inserted PHP script in to query the content of todo_list table

And confirmed this changes by adding */todo_list.php* to the (URL) public IP address on the webpage

PHP ready to connect and interact with the MySql server
